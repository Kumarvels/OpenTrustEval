# Cloudscale APIs & Webhooks

This directory contains API and webhook integration code, best practices, and deployment/testing guidance for running OpenTrustEval at cloud scale.

## Structure
- `endpoints/` — API endpoint implementations (REST, batch, webhook receivers)
- `webhooks/` — Outbound/inbound webhook handlers and utilities
- `tests/` — Automated tests and scenario scripts for pre-production validation
- `docs/` — API documentation, OpenAPI specs, and integration guides

## Best Practices
- Use clear separation between API logic, webhook handlers, and business logic.
- Secure all endpoints with authentication and input validation.
- Log all requests, responses, and errors for monitoring and audit.
- Use async processing for high-throughput endpoints.
- Provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all APIs.
- Support versioning for backward compatibility.
- Use environment variables for secrets and configuration.

## Testing Before Production
- All APIs and webhooks must have automated tests covering success, error, and edge cases.
- Include load and stress tests to validate scalability.
- Use mock services for external dependencies.
- Validate security (auth, input validation, rate limiting).
- Run integration tests in a staging environment before production deployment.

See subfolders for implementation and test examples.
