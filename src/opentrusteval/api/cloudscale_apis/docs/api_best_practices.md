# API & Webhook Best Practices for Cloudscale

## API Design
- Use RESTful principles and clear resource naming.
- Version APIs (e.g., /v1/evaluate) to support backward compatibility.
- Document all endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger.
- Use async endpoints for scalability.
- Validate all input with Pydantic models.
- Return clear error messages and status codes.

## Security
- Require authentication (API keys, OAuth, etc.) for all endpoints.
- Validate and sanitize all input to prevent injection attacks.
- Rate limit endpoints to prevent abuse.
- Log all access and errors for audit and monitoring.

## Webhooks
- Validate incoming webhook signatures if supported.
- Respond quickly (acknowledge, then process async if needed).
- Log all webhook events and errors.

## Testing Before Production
- Write automated tests for all endpoints and webhooks.
- Cover success, error, and edge cases.
- Use mock services for external dependencies.
- Run load and integration tests in staging before production.

## Deployment
- Use environment variables for secrets/config.
- Deploy behind HTTPS and a WAF if possible.
- Monitor logs, errors, and performance in production.

See the `tests/` folder for example test scenarios.
