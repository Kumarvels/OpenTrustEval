- **Orchestration Layer:** Real-time and batch workflow management.
- **Analytics & Monitoring:** Dashboards for insights and system health.
- **Security Layer:** PII detection, compliance, and access control.

### Design Principles
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each submodule handles a distinct responsibility.
- **Extensibility:** New algorithms, verifiers, or dashboards can be added with minimal friction.
- **Performance:** Aggressive caching, async processing, and resource optimization.
- **Explainability:** Every trust score and detection is accompanied by an explanation.

## 3. How It Works

1. **Input Reception:** Receives data or LLM output via API, batch, or real-time stream.
2. **Preprocessing:** Cleans, normalizes, and prepares input for analysis.
3. **Trust Scoring:** Routes input through MoE trust scoring and domain verifiers.
4. **Hallucination Detection:** Applies advanced detection algorithms (statistical, semantic, RAG-based).
5. **Remediation:** If issues are found, triggers remediation (e.g., human-in-the-loop, fallback models).
6. **Analytics & Monitoring:** Results are logged, visualized, and monitored for trends and anomalies.
7. **Security & Compliance:** PII and compliance checks are performed throughout the pipeline.

### 13.2 System Design: From Scratch to Advanced

#### a. Basic Building Blocks

| Component         | Role                                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Input Interface   | Receives data/LLM output (API, stream, batch)            |
| Preprocessing     | Cleans, normalizes, and validates input                  |
| Core Engine       | Runs trust scoring, hallucination detection, etc.        |
| Domain Verifiers  | Apply domain-specific logic                              |
| Orchestrator      | Manages workflow, routing, and escalation                |
| Analytics         | Logs, dashboards, and monitoring                         |
| Security Layer    | PII/compliance checks, access control                    |
| Output Interface  | Returns results, explanations, and triggers actions      |

#### b. Real-Time Data Flow (Step-by-Step)

1. **Input Reception**
   - Data or LLM output arrives via REST API, message queue, or direct call.
   - Example: A user submits a prompt to the system for trust evaluation.
2. **Preprocessing**
   - Input is validated (format, size, schema).
   - Normalization (e.g., text cleaning, language detection).
   - Metadata is attached (timestamp, user, domain).
3. **Routing & Orchestration**
   - The orchestrator determines the processing path (real-time, batch, or hybrid).
   - For real-time, it prioritizes low-latency, async processing.
4. **Trust Scoring (MoE)**
   - The input is routed to the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) trust scoring engine.
   - Multiple expert models (statistical, ML, rule-based) evaluate the input.
   - Results are aggregated for a composite trust score.
5. **Domain Verification**
   - If a domain is specified (e.g., medical, legal), domain verifiers apply specialized logic.
   - May include cross-referencing with domain knowledge bases.
6. **Hallucination Detection**
   - Advanced algorithms check for hallucinations (fact-checking, RAG, semantic similarity).
   - If a hallucination is detected, the system flags the result and may trigger remediation.
7. **Remediation & Escalation**
   - For ambiguous or high-risk cases, the system can:
     - Escalate to a human reviewer (human-in-the-loop)
     - Trigger fallback models or workflows
8. **Analytics & Monitoring**
   - All results, scores, and explanations are logged.
   - Dashboards update in real-time for monitoring and trend analysis.
9. **Security & Compliance**
   - PII and compliance checks are performed at every stage.
   - Access controls and audit logs are maintained.
10. **Output & Integration**
    - The final trust score, risk assessment, and explanation are returned via API or UI.
    - Results can trigger downstream actions (alerts, reports, automated decisions).

#### c. Advanced Concepts

i. Asynchronous & Parallel Processing
- Uses Python’s `asyncio` and concurrent processing to handle thousands of requests per second.
- Batch processing is available for large datasets, but real-time requests are prioritized.

ii. Caching & Performance Optimization
- Frequently used models and data are cached in memory.
- Results of common queries are memoized to reduce computation.

iii. Pluggable Architecture
- New trust scoring modules, verifiers, or detectors can be added by dropping them into the appropriate folder and registering them.
- Plugin system allows for compliance, localization, or custom business logic.

iv. Explainability & Traceability
- Every output includes a detailed explanation of how the score was derived.
- Audit logs are kept for all decisions, supporting compliance and debugging.

v. Security by Design
- All data flows are checked for PII and compliance.
- Secrets and credentials are managed securely.
- Access is controlled via roles and policies.

### 13.4 Key Points & Best Practices

- **Design for scale:** Use async, batching, and caching to handle real-time loads.
- **Keep modules independent:** Each module should have a clear, single responsibility.
- **Prioritize explainability:** Always return explanations and keep audit logs.
- **Secure by default:** PII checks, secrets management, and access control are non-negotiable.
- **Monitor everything:** Use analytics dashboards for real-time and historical insights.
- **Support human-in-the-loop:** For high-risk or ambiguous cases, escalate to human review.

```python
import requests
payload = {"input": "AI output to evaluate", "domain": "finance"}
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/trust/score", json=payload)
print(response.json())
```
**Sample Output:**
```json
{
  "trust_score": 0.92,
  "risk": 0.08,
  "hallucination_detected": false,
  "explanation": "Verified by MoE and finance domain expert. No hallucination detected."
}
```
