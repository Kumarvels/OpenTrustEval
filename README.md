# 🌐 OpenTrustEval: A Universal Trustworthy AI Framework

### ✅ **Purpose**

**OpenTrustEval** is a flexible and powerful framework built to help you **evaluate how much you can trust AI-generated content** — whether it's text from a language model like GPT or Gemini, or answers from image/video understanding models.

It answers questions like:

* ❓ *Is this AI response factual or hallucinated?*
* 📉 *Is the AI reliable across different use cases?*
* 🔍 *Can I monitor trust scores for every output over time?*

---

## 🧱 Key Concept: What is Trust in AI?

“Trust” in AI means:

* **Accuracy**: Is the answer factually correct?
* **Reliability**: Does it consistently give good results?
* **Explainability**: Can we understand why it gave this answer?
* **Safety**: Does it avoid harmful, biased, or unethical outputs?

**OpenTrustEval** lets you **measure, monitor, and improve** all of the above.

## 🔄 How It Works – Step by Step

### 1. **Input Collection**

Send a prompt or input to any LLM or multimodal model (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, Mistral, etc.)

### 2. **Output Evaluation Pipeline**

The model’s output passes through the **OpenTrustEval engine**, which evaluates it using:

* ✅ **Fact-Checking Modules** (against a trusted source like Wikipedia, Google Knowledge Graph, or custom databases)
* ⚖️ **Bias & Toxicity Detectors**
* 🧠 **Hallucination Risk Estimators**
* 📏 **Custom Rule-based or ML-based Scorers**

Each component gives a **Trust Score** (e.g., 0 to 100) along with reasons and metadata.

### 3. **Trust Score Report**

Outputs include:

* Final Trust Score
* Risk label (e.g., Safe, Warning, Dangerous)
* Explanation of issues found (e.g., “Factual inconsistency in 2nd sentence”)
* Suggestions or auto-rewrite (optional)

## 🧩 Example Use Cases

| Domain            | Application                                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧑‍⚕️ Healthcare  | Verify AI-generated summaries of medical documents                |
| 🎓 Education      | Check factual correctness of AI tutors or quiz creators           |
| 📰 Media          | Detect hallucinations in AI-generated news or reports             |
| 👨‍💼 Enterprises | Ensure AI chatbots or assistants are compliant, fair, and factual |
| 🔐 Security       | Filter out misleading or harmful AI outputs in real time          |

---

## 🔌 Plugin-Based Architecture

You can plug in your own:

* Fact-checking databases
* Custom logic rules (e.g., “never generate URLs”)
* Hallucination detection models (e.g., fine-tuned classifiers)
* Language-specific validators
* Human-in-the-loop override systems

This makes **OpenTrustEval** future-proof and usable across different AI tools or organizations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install via pip or Docker**

   ```bash
   pip install opentrusteval
   # or
   docker run opentrusteval/server
   ```

2. **Configure Your Pipeline**
   Define what you want to measure in a YAML config:

   ```yaml
   trust_pipeline:
     - fact_check
     - hallucination_score
     - bias_detector
     - custom_rule_matcher
   ```

3. **Send a Prompt + Response for Evaluation**

   ```python
   from opentrusteval import evaluate
   result = evaluate(prompt="Who won World War 3?", response="Canada in 2042.")
   print(result.score, result.explanation)
   ```

4. **Use the REST API**

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/evaluate -d '{...}'
   ```

## 📉 Sample Output

```json
{
  "trust_score": 47.2,
  "label": "Warning",
  "issues": [
    {"type": "Factual Error", "detail": "World War 3 has not occurred."},
    {"type": "Speculation", "detail": "No evidence of 'Canada in 2042'."}
  ],
  "suggestion": "Use historical data only"
}
```
